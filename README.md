# IOTA Workshop

Simple examples to help a developer work through interacting with the IOTA network and the [iota.js](https://github.com/iota/iota.js) library. 

### Getting started

To start playing with these examples run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iota-community/iota-workshop.git
cd iota-workshop
npm install # or yarn install
